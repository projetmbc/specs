The integration of \latex \specs has shown the necessity to simplify and clarify a lot of things. Work starts today on the verb::''dev'' branch, and will result in a major \numver change.

Here is what was done that day.

    * \Intro rewritten.
    * \Gene rules rethought: let's get to work...

\latex - Ignore.

    1) path::''about.yaml'': this type of file can just indicate how to sort the files or folders to be analysed. It is no longer possible to use an path::''about.yaml'' file to locally ignore files and folders.

    1) Tests and tools: the new \specs are more flexible for the names of the test and tool files.

[[:api:]]
\latex: here is what has been improved.

    1) Aggregating \packs: in the path::''about.yaml'' file, the paths to the \packs to be aggregated must end in yaml::''/''.

    1) yaml::''toc'' block of a path::''about.yaml'' file: we just use what is indicated without automatically adding some remaining files, except for ext::''tex'' files associated with ext::''sty'' files.

    1) \Tech \doc: just the \src code is used (with the possibility of translations into languages other than English).

    1) Resource: no more analysis of the code \latex of the \doc typed by the coder but everything must pass via relative paths.

    1) Macros and starred \envs: no longer offered.

    1) Language support: the names to be used are those proposed by the \babel \pack.

    1) Non-retroactive changes: we act abruptly with no transition period (simpler to maintain and classic in the \latex world).

    1) The path::''build_'' prefix is no longer marked as to be ignored for the final product. If necessary, path::''tool_build_'' should be used as the prefix.

[[:api:]]
\latex - Several new features.

    1) Just for the path::''src/about.yaml'' file: the yaml::''texfacto'' block lets you specify a file to use as the header for the ext::''tex'' file in the user \doc.

    1) For any path::''about.yaml'' file, this is what has been added.

        + A yaml::''ignore'' block can be used to indicate files to be ignored locally or globally for the final product in addition to those of type path::''test_'' and path::''tool_''.

        + You can use the \glob syntax for the yaml::''toc'' and yaml::''ignore'' blocks.

    1) \Tech \docs.

        + A user \tech \doc and a hacker one are proposed.

        + Possibility of hiding some \signs just for the "simple user" version via the starred tnsdoc::''prototype*::''.

    1) About translatable content.

        + Naming uses two options depending on the context: either the verb::''ISO 639-1'' standard, or via the conventions of the \pack \babel.

        + The contributions folder looks like this:

        dirview::
            + contribute
                + doc
                    + changelog
                        + fr [...]
                    + manual
                        + fr [...]
                    + tech
                        + en [...]

:update:

[[:api:]]
\latex - Project folder: the path::''contribute'' and path::''readme'' subfolders are optional.


[[:doc:]]
\latex: many clarifications have been made.

    1) It has been clearly stated that for each \dev subfolder, the settings related to a language should be placed in a path::''locale'' subfolder.

    1) The \pdf files associated with a \ext::''tex'' file included in the user \doc will always be ignored in the final \prod.

    1) \Tech \docs: macros or \envs created dynamically via latex::''\csname'' type functions should be clearly explained in the \protos.

    1) ... \etc.

:fordev:

[[:tech:]]
\latex: update relating to \tns: use of path::''?/'' instead of path::'':?../'' for systematic ascending/descending file and folder searches.
